I want to go to UCLA and major in political science for college! I have always wanted to be a corporate lawyer when I get older. 

Struggles: One of my biggest struggles and problems was getting my python to work, it was a problem that I did not know how to fix and it was interfering with my actual code, but luckily Mr. Mortensen helped me figure that out and it all ended up working out.
