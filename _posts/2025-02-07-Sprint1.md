## Issue: Project-Based Learning Requirements  

Each sprint will include **hacks** and **project-based learning requirements**. It is up to the individual to develop their own plan for how they will represent their work. Here are some key points and tips:  

- All **tangible artifacts** will be captured in personal **GitHub Pages**.  
- **Tools and Software Development** requirements are foundational for all **CompSci courses**. These are shared but listed under **CSSE Projects**.  
- To **clarify instructions**, start by picking a post in **Sprint 1**, then ask questions.  
- In **Agile Development methodology**, each iteration (plans, designs, review references, coding) and **questions** should be considered as part of your work.  
- Since **iteration and questions** are part of your work, consider capturing and outlining them in your **blog**.  
- You will earn more **"Points"** if you demonstrate **progress** on your CompSci journey.  
- There are very few **"Correct Answers"** in this class! As you code, you will discover **bugs and new features** continuously.

## Classroom Guidelines  

ðŸš¨ **Avoid saying**:  
> *"I have everything done."*  

This statement often comes from students who **lack understanding** of CompSci and **iteration principles**. In fact, this **contradicts Agile Development methodologies** that we will be learning in this class.  

The **Teacher values** behaviors that are **visible, productive, and contribute to CompSci learning**:  

### âœ… **Key Behaviors for Success**  

1. **Code, Code, Code.**  
   - Engage in the full process: **planning, designing, reviewing references, asking questions, and coding**.  

2. **No Paper.**  
   - All work will be done **electronically**.  

3. **Work Talk.**  
   - At least **75-80%** of your class discussions should be about **coding**.  

4. **Ears that can listen.**  
   - Be available for discussions **100% of the time**. **Earbuds/headphones** should not restrict hearing.  

5. **Hands that can code.**  
   - Your **laptop** is your primary coding device. Sprint 1 will emphasize its importance.  

ðŸ“Œ **Read the Learning Habits Table** to understand how behaviors will impact grading.
