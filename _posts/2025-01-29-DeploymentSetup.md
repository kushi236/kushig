## What I Learned:
### I learned how to put a website online so that people can use it. I connected the frontend (what users see) with the backend (how it works) so they talk to each other properly. I set up a server on AWS EC2, learning how to turn it on, keep it safe, and make sure it runs well.

### I also learned how to use Docker to pack my website into a container so it works the same everywhere. I set up Nginx to help send website traffic to the right place and make it run faster. I used Certbot to add HTTPS, which makes websites safe. I also practiced fixing errors when things didn’t work.

## How I Will Use It:
### Putting My Own Websites Online – I can now launch my own projects for people to use.
### Making Websites Faster & Safer – Using Nginx and HTTPS, I can improve security and speed.
### Fixing Problems Better – I now know how to find and fix errors when things go wrong.
### Growing Bigger Projects – Docker will help me scale my websites in the future.
### Helping Others – I can use these skills for jobs or freelance work.


## How I Will Apply It (Step by Step):

### Putting My Own Websites Online
## I will create a website and write the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend (Node.js, Python, etc.).
### I will set up an AWS EC2 server and upload my project files.
### I will make sure the frontend and backend are connected and working properly.

## Making Websites Faster & Safer
### I will install Nginx on my server to manage website traffic and improve speed.
### I will use Certbot to add an SSL certificate so my site uses HTTPS for security.
### I will configure Nginx to handle multiple requests smoothly.

## Fixing Problems Better
### I will check server logs and error messages to find problems.
### I will use debugging tools to figure out what is broken and how to fix it.
### I will test my website after making changes to make sure everything still works.

## Growing Bigger Projects
### I will use Docker to package my app so it works the same everywhere.
### I will create Docker containers for my frontend, backend, and database.
### I will deploy my app in a way that makes it easy to update and scale.
