1. What you learned from the quiz?

I learnt how the actual ap exam will be like and the format of the questions on the exam. The test also contained several concepts that we haven't covered yet like the impact of computing and other varieties that I will look forward to understanding.

2. What type of questions do you feel you are weak on?

I don't feel confident on the questions that aren't strictly coding or the questions that ask me to point out a specific reason there is a failure in the sequence.

Corrections- 

Q1-  Swap Values first and second; Second <- Temp, I got this question wrong because I did not understand how to correctly respond. 

Q9- Benefits of incremental and iterative development; It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program. I got this wrong because I wasn't comprehending the premise of vocab questions.

Q11- Simulate spinner with three unequal sections; Returns to red. I misinterpreted this question by not analyzing the pie chart better.

Q21- Comparing robot algorithms; Move x times 2, Right X times 3, and Move x times 3; I got this wrong because I didn't realize how the code segment moves the robot forward two squares then rotates it right on time.

Q23- Redundant routing with four computers; Answer B; I got this wrong because redundant routing doesn't occur when there is only one path from one device to another. 

Q24- Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters- Answer C; I got this wrong because some characters of the original string don't show up in the encoded string so it is not lossy.

Q25- Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS; Answer B; I got this wrong because the string could actually be shortened due to the byte pair encoding.

Q26- Completing robot code by adding if statement; Answer A; I got this wrong because that code segment just moved the robot one square forward from its start point. 

Q29- Diagram with three logic gates; Answer A; I got this wrong because with those inputs the gates would produce the wrong outputs which would lead the circuit to have an ouput of true.

Q30- Video-streaming service by genre; Answer D; I got this wrong because that assumption assumed that the procedure is called once.

Q31- Comparing loop algorithms with robots; Answer C; I got this wrong because Program 2 also correctly moves the robot to the gray square.

Q33- Apartment rental website flowchart; Answer A; I got this wrong because that particular expression would not correctly set include to true in cases where one out of two conditions is set to true.

Q34- Mouse and predator simulations; Answer D; I got this wrong because the number of mice change each day due to the determination of the procedures.

Q51- Examples of symmetric encryption; Answer B; I got this wrong because it was an example of an asymmetric system due to the fact that different codes lead to send and recieve messages.

Q52- Algorithms to identify palindrome words in list; Answer D; I got this wrong because option 1 doesn't work since it performs the steps before the palindromes steps.

Q54- Abstraction with procedures Square and Cube; Answer D; I got this wrong because the add procedure leads to a calculation in the power of n.

Q55- Results of the keepplaying procedure; Answer D; I got this wrong because the procedure will always return false.

Q56- Skip counting integers in a loop; Answer D; I got this wrong because this program only counted odd integers, not the even integers.

Q57- Generate Happy from Harp and Puppy; Answer B; I got this wrong because that expression turned the string into Hapy again. 

Q61- Data about students at East and West High School- Answer A; I got this partially correct because instead of the school determining the school id of the student with the greatest number of absences they can create a single list of student names, sorted by last name.

Q65- Correcting errors in procedure Multiply; Answers B & D; I got this wrong because if x is negative and y is positive the procedure will correctly calculate the product by adding x to itself to the amount of y times. 


Q66- Test cases for procedure Smallest; Answer C; I got this partially correct because the procedure returns the first numer it sees that is less than the first number in the list.
