# Trimester Summary & What I Learned

This trimester, I learned how to build and connect different parts of a software system. I worked with **databases, backend logic, and user features** like **notifications** to improve user experience.

## Key Things I Learned:
- **Using Databases:** Storing and managing data with SQLite.  
- **Backend Development:** Creating models and linking user actions.  
- **Full-Stack Work:** Connecting the frontend and backend to make things work smoothly.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Writing logic for tracking and ranking data.  

At first, I struggled with backend development, especially handling models and API logic. However, with the help of my teammates, I improved my understanding of database relationships, user authentication, and how data flows between the frontend and backend. This teamwork made a huge difference in my progress and boosted my confidence.  

Overall, I got better at coding, organizing data, and making features work together.
