## 5 things completed this trimester 

### 1. I created a notification system where the user is able to send any content, regarding gift ideas, upcoming events, and gift recomendations to any other user and it will appear on their end.

### 2. I worked on both backend and frontend to create a full stack feature, but when I struggled, my group helped me when I fell short in my understanding, the code uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the notifications.

### 3. The code fetches user data (GET /api/users/id-name) to populate the recipient dropdown, sends notifications to the backend (POST /api/notification), and retrieves them (GET /api/notifications) to display on the frontend.

### 4. I created a burndown list to plan my User Notifications System, outlining how to fetch users, send notifications, store them in the database, and display them on the UI.

### 5. I created 6 different subcategories for different gift ideas, in order to make it much more efficient for the user to access the website.
