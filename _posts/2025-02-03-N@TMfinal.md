### At Night at the Museum, I demonstrated a notification feature from my full-stack project. I showed how users can pick a recipient from a dropdown (populated via our API), type a message, and send it. When they submit the form, the app sends a POST request to store the notification and then retrieves and displays all notifications in real time. I also added a playful touch with a bouncing emoji animation.

### During the demo, peers suggested:

### 1. Replacing the basic alert with a modal for clearer feedback.
### 2. Adding timestamps to each notification.
### 3. Improving error messages and including a loading spinner during API calls.

### I took their advice, updated my project, and also shared helpful feedback on other projects, which made the whole event a great learning experience.

### I also looked at a CSA presentation and saw that their presentation interested me in pursuing that course!
